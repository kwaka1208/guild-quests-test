# Guild Quests

Weekly reading quests for the guild. Each week a new quest folder
(`quest-00/`, `quest-01/`, ...) appears in this repository.

This is also an **open source project**. If you find a typo, a broken link,
or a confusing sentence, you can fix it and send a pull request.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting started

You work on **your own copy** of this repository, called a *fork*.

1. Click **Fork** at the top right of this page, then **Create fork**.
2. Clone **your fork** (replace `YOUR-ID` with your GitHub ID):

       git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ID/guild-quests.git
       cd guild-quests

## Before each class: get the new quest

New quests are added to the original repository (we call it *upstream*).
Bring them into your fork:

1. Open your fork on GitHub and click **Sync fork**, then **Update branch**.
2. In your terminal:

       git pull

> **Note:** If `git pull` fails because you changed a file, run `git stash`
> and try again.

## Playing a quest

1. Open a terminal in your fork, and move into the quest folder. For example:

       cd quest-00

   If you cannot find the folder, see "Before each class" above.

2. Read the quest's `README.md`.
3. Run `quest.py` and answer every stage. At the end, you get a flag:

       FLAG{xxxxxxxxxx}

4. Submit the flag in **Guild HQ** with the **Submit a Flag** form:
   https://github.com/kwaka1208/guild-hq/issues/new/choose

Your flag is made from your GitHub ID, so it works only for you.
